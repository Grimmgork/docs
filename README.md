# docs
A system wich stores real documents in a obsidan vault.
It uses Tesseract OCR to create a searchable PDF document from a scan
and stores a transcript of each page as a text file.
The content of the documents can then be searched for in obsidian.
The transcripts are conveniently linked to the original PDF.

## dependencies:
- https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract
- https://github.com/charlesw/tesseract/
- and Obsidian to use the database: https://github.com/obsidianmd
